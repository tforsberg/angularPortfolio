            <p>This application was an assignment at KPU <a href="http://www.kpu.ca/calendar/2016-17/courses/info/index.html#info2313">INFO 2313</a> wherein all object oriented principles learned were to be demonstrated.</p>

            <p>It is a game of crazy eights played through the command line. A user can play against a computer, or two computers can be pitted against eachother</p>
            
            <p>In order to play the game, the player is shown the contents of their hand and asked to play a card by entering a number or to draw a new card.</p>

            <p>The first player to have an empty hand wins!</p>

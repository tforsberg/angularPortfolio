        <h2>Status: Complete</h2>

            <p>Link to <a href="https://github.com/thaniri/tpc2017">Github</a></p>

            <img class="projectPic" src="./images/tpc2017.jpg" href="https://github.com/thaniri/tpc2017"/>

            <p>This site was built from scratch using PHP. The database that powers the site is on a MySQL server hosted by AWS.</p>

        <h2>Code design</h2>

            <p>As much as possible the site was built with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> principle in mind. 
                In order to reduce code repetition, the pages were built on a template that imports repeated elements such as the header and footer. 
                The only part of any given page that changes is the main content. Everything else is found in a central location.</p>

        <h2>UI Design</h2>

            <p>Much like the portfolio you're on right now, the UI was inspired by <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/">Material Design</a> by Google.
            Everything from colours to layout to typography was lifted and transferred over to both my portfolio and this e-commerce site.
            Material Design is brilliant and easy to understand. It was a no brainer to use it.</p>

        <h2>Security:</h2>

            <p>Some of the security considerations in building this site were password hashing, SQL injection protection, and end-to-end encryption.</p>

        <h2>Todo:</h2>

        <p>Major things that could still be done:</p>
        <ul class="circleList">
            <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/launch-lamp-web-app/">Hosting</a></li>
            <li>SSL</li>
        </ul>
